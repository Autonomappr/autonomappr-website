            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p class="lead">Construction projects are currently notorious for being behind schedule, over budget, and dangerous for construction workers. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics’ 2015 Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, construction is the leading industry in worker injuries and fatalities. Autonomous technology can have a huge positive impact on construction, increasing efficiency and lowering worker exposure to dangerous situations. However, construction sites are ad-hoc environments with constantly changing temporary roads, materials being moved, and structures being built. This can be a very difficult environment for autonomous solutions to navigate. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 mr-auto">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p class="lead">In our Capstone Project we aim to build a solution that autonomously builds an accurate and up to date 3D model of a given construction site. This will be done using a drone. The site model will contain a 3D spatial occupancy grid as well as labelled roads and points of interest. This information will be provided to other systems on the site wirelessly, enabling autonomous solutions to navigate the site and work together.</p>

            <h6>February 14</h6>

            <h5>Drone Hardware</h5>
            <p class="entry blog-post">The hardware platform is complete and ready for testing, with the exception of the camera. Manual flight testing will begin shortly and will expose any errors in calibration or setup that may have occurred.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-1 center-text">

              <p>Final Drone Hardware (Excluding camera)</p>
            </div>

            <h5>Camera</h5>
            <p class="entry blog-post">The camera hardware is currently held back by issues the team has had with interfacing with it. The camera manufacturer has provided the team with the code required to interface with it, but there is work still yet to be done in order to fully integrate it within the drone’s software stack.</p>

            <h5>Mission Planner</h5>
            <p class="entry blog-post">This is the portion of the pipeline that plans the path that the drone should take given an address or GPS coordinates of the construction site location. So far, the mission planner code is able to generate a set of GPS coordinates that represent the drone’s proposed path. Further work is needed to determine the optimal spacing of points to achieve desired overlap between images. Additionally, the code will eventually need to interface with the drone control software in order to translate the set of points into actual drone movements.</p>

            </div>

            <h5>Drone Control</h5>
            <p class="entry blog-post">In the context of the project, “Drone Control” refers to the software that will run on the drone itself that instructs the flight control software about what to do (fly to waypoint, take picture, etc.). At the moment, the code runs inside a simulated environment. Some work is left to translate this work into code that will make the drone fly.</p>

            <h3>Progress on All Fronts</h3>
            <h6>January 29</h6>

            <p class="entry blog-post">After a series of design meetings the previous week, the ground work was performed both from a hardware and software perspective. Point cloud filtering, website backend and frontend interfaces, drone flight simulation and hardware setup and bringup were all performed by the team members to ensure that no critical component was left unattended.</p>

            <p class="entry blog-post"><strong>Hardware Setup/Bringup</strong></p>
            <p class="entry blog-post">After 3D printing the necessary brackets, the drone was assembled and connected to the provided base station running on a laptop and obtained from Ardupilot. This confirmed that all drone modules worked as expected. The next step is to connect the controller to the drone so that manual flight can be performed.</p>

            <p class="entry blog-post"><strong>Point Cloud Filtering</strong></p>
            <p class="entry blog-post">To filter point clouds, the point cloud is first mapped to an image, where the (x,y) coordinates are mapped to (i,j) indices and the z-coordinate becomes the intensity. This method assumes that the (x,y) coordinates do not contain erroneous data, and that the filtering will be performed on the height data. This simplifies the filtering process while maintaining an accurate representation of the data.</p>
            <p class="entry blog-post">Given a set resolution, the (x,y) coordinates of each point is mapped to an (i,j) index tuple, and once each point has been mapped, inpainting is applied to avoid image pixels having no associated data. Without inpainting, any filtering method would introduce more erroneous data since it would rely on non-existent data for smoothing, edge enhancement, outlier removal, etc.</p>
            <p class="entry blog-post">The data is then filtered through a given method, which will be decided upon based on the obtained data from testing. The filtered image can then be mapped back to a point cloud for further data handling (exporting to STL, adding GPS data, etc.).</p>

            <p class="entry blog-post"><strong>POI Website Interface</strong></p>
            <p class="entry blog-post">In order to add the roads and Points of Interest(POI) on the map, a web interface has been implemented where a user can click and connect different points over an orthophoto or the generated point cloud.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-1 center-text">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/progress_updates/website_screenshot.png" alt="">
              <p>Website Prototype</p>
            </div>

            <p class="entry blog-post">As shown in the picture above, the interface still requires design work but feature-wise, the website is almost complete. The roads are saved and can be reload by accessing the website. Roads can also be added, deleted, and modified by the user at any point in the process.</p>

            <p class="entry blog-post"><strong>Ardupilot Simulation</strong></p>
            <p class="entry blog-post">The ROS-enabled Ardupilot simulation was also setup during the week and a pre-built model of a drone was used to perform a given mission plan. From this initial testing, further work can be performed on the mission plan generation, as well as properly linking the simulation with real hardware.</p>

            <p class="entry blog-post">We printed the mounting bracket for the camera hardware and the design for the anti-vibration bed for the controller is complete.

            <h3>Intro to Autonomappr</h3>
            <h6>January 16</h6>
            <p class="entry blog-post">Today, according to Global Projects Database, large projects in the construction industry are late by an average of 20% than originally scheduled with some up to nine years. According to the same study the projects are also are over budget by an average 80% with some as high as 650% [1].  In addition, almost 50 workers are injured every minute of the workweek and 17 deaths occur per day in the USA, according to OSHA [2]. <br><br> Despite technological improvements, many projects are over-budget, over-time and dangerous. Autonomappr aims to provide an accurate site model with labelled point of interests to effectively increase efficiency and mitigate safety concerns by enabling autonomous technology on a construction site. The project objectives are outlined below.</p>
